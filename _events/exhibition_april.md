I don’t create art with my camera, I just press the shutter and make images.
An image is a slice of sample taken from the immense time.
It stores a minor occurrence from reality.
If this sample brings you a temporary state of mind,
if it makes you feel something,
it becomes art.
Your fantasy drives an image beyond its mundane reality, as the image drives you into a fantasy.
See? I don’t create art. You do.
Enjoy.
