What about transferring your home-office to Zarah and to join our Pop-Up Yoga taking place every first Monday of the month?</br>
If you are tired of sitting the whole day, your neck is sore and your eyes hurt from staring at your laptop, why don’t you boost your energy with a 20 minutes session of free office yoga with instructor Yiyang ? </br>
For the ones who were regularly attending our Pop-Up office Yoga, we want to announce that our session on June 18th will be cancelled. </br>
However, starting from Monday July 2nd, and every first Monday of the month yoga instructor Yiyang will be joining us for special sessions of Pop-Up Office Yoga at Zarah. There is no need for reservations, no participation fee and you don’t need to bring your yoga mats, either! </br>
Just come to Zarah on Monday July 2nd and squeeze some office yoga into your schedule from 3:00-3:20pm for a good & healthy start of the month! </br>
