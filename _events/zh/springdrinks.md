Yes, that’s right! It’s “Karneval” with a “k” and not a “c” because we are talking about the German “Karneval” with its fun customs, colorful kids’ activities and special food which will be waiting for you at our Sunday Brunch on March 3rd. If you want to celebrate mardi gras the German way, then join us for a German carnival inspired brunch at Zarah!
This time our delicious all-you-can-eat brunch buffet will feature some German specials such as “Bretzel”, German Potato Salad, Pork Neck Steak as well as German sausages. Of course, homemade “Berliner” (German doughnuts) and “Amerikaner” (sponge cakes with icing) which are popular sweets during carnival in Germany will be found in the dessert corner as well. Our Sunday-Brunch classics will also be on offer, including our wide selection of cheeses and cold cuts, smoked salmon, freshly baked bread and croissants, our live egg-cooking station, artfully prepared salads and homemade cakes!
Well, without German beer it wouldn’t be a real “Karneval”, right? Therefore, this time our all-you-can-eat-and-drink option will include free flow of German Paulaner beer, hot Gluehwine, high quality wines, prosecco and Zarah’s secret-recipe cocktails – using fresh and seasonal ingredients!
Don’t forget to bring along the little ones because our friends from Kids Planet Hutong will organize many captivating and fun activities for children in our courtyard, as well as candy-throwing with showers of “Konfetti” and “Luftschlangen” (paper blow-outs), which is “the” tradition during “Karneval” parades in Germany.
And here comes the most important part: carnivals are about being dressed up! Everyone who shows up in costumes of their choice including kids will have the chance to join our lucky draw in order to win Sunday Brunch vouchers.
So, if you have never celebrated mardi gras the German way, then don’t miss this opportunity and join our “Karneval Brunch @ Zarah”!
