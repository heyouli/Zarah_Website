It’s time again to celebrate Easter with colorful kids’ activities including egg hunts in our garden and a festive Easter-style Sunday Brunch at Zarah!
Also this year we are planning to pamper you with many homemade delicacies which will be waiting for you in our all-you-can-eat brunch buffet. Be ready for special Easter treats such as deviled eggs, roasted butter carrots, green asparagus & smoked salmon pasta, German Hefezopf, freshly baked pastry bunnies, and of course self-colored Easter eggs. Don’t worry, our popular brunch classics will be still on offer including our extensive cheese and cold cut platters, our live egg-cooking station, healthy salads and more!
So why not let the kids go on egg hunt, while you lean back and enjoy the beautiful spring weather maybe with a glass of prosecco?
For those who want to have more than “a” glass of Prosecco, we can offer our all-you-can-eat-and-drink option which includes free flow beer, high quality wines, prosecco and Zarah’s secret-recipe cocktails - using fresh and seasonal ingredients!
Let’s welcome Easter all together at our Easter-inspired Sunday Brunch on April 21st.
Happy Easter!
